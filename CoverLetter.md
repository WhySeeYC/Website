Dear Miss Beverley Smith,

<Foreword>
I am writing to you to express my interest of joining Serif as a Technical Writer.  With my desire to support content creators and designers by applying skills in technical writing, I found this opportunity resonates with me deeply.

<!--I approached Dr Emily Neil (currently Ecosystem Scientist at Serif) to inquire some insights about the product and vision that Serif plans to contribute to the wider society.-->

<Personal feeling>
<!--
I really enjoy learning new tools, communicating and bonding with colleagues, and that is also why I took the initiative to reach out to Ms. Shati Patel, Mr Matt Pollard and Dr. Ana Armas Romero who are current Serif engineers and technical writer. I am extremely grateful for their openness at sharing insights about Serif DOCs team's structure, and documentation production/review workflow and each of their work productivity tips. Through these interactions, I can see Serif shares very similar practices that I had been trying to foster in my current work place; to create a culture that encourages people to make clear and kind communication and be open about one's work (especially when reviewing other people's creation, or when collaborating with external teams).
Their transition stories to engineering team and from customer support team gave me confidence that my previous skills in structure-based authoring and single-source publishing will be highly translatable and able to contribute to Serif DOCs team’s productivity. I also had the chance to connect with Miss Ana Armas Romero (current senior software engineer). She not only shared with me the culture perspectives and social interaction but also the collaborative practice, pull request, and how people across Serif teams creatively use it to help them grow.
The reason I found the Serif DOCs team meets my career expectation is the team structure that empowers the work that people contribute to. The DOCs team consists of the content creating squad and the docs.github.com developer squad. This provides an opportunity to actively engage both the logical (science) side and creative (humanity) side of our brains. I had found myself thrive under a similar environment which I will detail the reasons. 
When understanding these relevant experiences can have formal input from specialised professionals, I find Serif DOCs team a perfect fit for me, and I can clearly see myself communicate happily with both the back-end content creating squad and the front-end website engineering squad. 
Because of Serif’s core value of open-source knowledge, the writers and developers partake as both the user and the creator of a product. This fosters empathy and asynchronous improvement beyond Serif’s customers and employees. The fact that I gained a deeper understanding of Serif’s culture and vision is a great example of how their openness benefits a potential member. 
-->

<!--Another aspect that draws my heart is the generosity from Serif. I learned from Emily that Serif provides a number of free assets analysis for businesses that don't have similar financial baseline as well-developed corporations. This truly is a representation of the team's openness and inclusiveness which I deeply hope to be part of.-->

Currently, I work at a medical technology company as an Imaging Solution Scientist. One of my responsibilities is to produce imaging acquisition manuals in a scalable manner. In 2021 alone, I published 98 user manuals (each of them was at least 20 pages long) in 8 months period. My target audience are medical radiographers. Due to the fast-paced nature of their clinical profession, there is limited time to read through complex documents. The manuals I wrote therefore consist of simple actionable procedures with media explanations that are specifically customised base on the setup that each radiographer works on. To do this, I implement topic-based authoring concept by filtering out only the contents that are relevant for specified facilities and software systems. For Serif's products Affinity Designer and Affinity Photo, this means the iMac, iPad and Windows users can have guidance specifically customised to the set-up they have. To increase the efficiency of documentation production, I reuse different levels of contents across publications by harmonizing common sections and embedding variables/functions into my writings. This not only ensures consistent writing style among all authors at the time of production, but also ensures the documents to be consistent across time along the  new features development of the products.


<!--
As you can see, this requires a good understanding of high-level procedures and skills of interpreting system-specific terminology across platforms. Because Serif is a multi-facet platform, I believe this skill will specifically be helpful at delivering user documentations in a consistent manner across Serif's products. -->

While maintaining the source documents in Markdown and XML to ensure sustainability of the master document, I also implement single source publishing practice to produce rich-formatted output such as PDF and HTML webpages. I foresee this experience will especially be helpful to support the presentation capability of Serif's product Affinity Publisher.

<!--This in turn allows the integration with SWE’s platform pipeline.  production of API guidances derived from the communications with the Serif’s developers.-->

In conclusion, with my previous professional experience in technical writing, I have the confidence to be an excellent asset to Serif. Please give my application a consideration. I look forward to hearing from you. Should there be any further questions, please feel free to contact me. Thank you very much.

<CG Life Scientific Writer, Content Specialist>
<!-- I am Yi-Chun Wang and currently I work as an Imaging Applications Scientist in Oxford biotechnology company, Perspectum. I am writing to you regarding the Scientific Writer/Content specialist advertised at the career page on CG Life website. I know about this role because of the influence from Dr Gertrude Nonterah.
From my career and educational journey, I put a lot of effort becoming proficient at technical and medical writing. Since 2020 March onwards, I have been writing MRI oriented technical documents for my clients include major pharmaceutical companies such as Akero, Eli Lilly, Bio89, Fractyl and Jassen, etc. During a period of 8 months, I was able to produce at least 98 sets of 20-pages technical manuals for these Pharma clients. This type of output requires excellent working knowledge in MRI device vendor’s technology advancement. In addition, I also produced a systematic literature review article (256 page long) for my current company’s flagship product, which was subsequently submitted to Japan PDMA for medical device clearance assessment. This work specifically requires a good understanding of liver disease epidemiology. In May 2022, I also submitted a scientific poster to present at the International Society of Magnetic Resonance and Medicine conference. Specifically, while producing this work, I was able to make difficult quantitative MR concepts into a digestible 5-minute presentation and to piqued meaningful discussions with scientists on site. During my free time, I enjoy producing blog posts and YouTube videos on various educational-oriented topics. This especially gives me opportunity to be creative at personal branding and to be active in communications with audience.
CG Life to me will be a next level up for my scientific creating career as I envision this role will expose me to a larger scope of medical writing including different disease areas and a diverse selection of health technologies in addition to medical imaging. I believe CG Life’s content creation team will also be able to benefit from my prior experience of making written materials more re-usable, scalable, and standardized or in general just consume some good vibes when I am around!
Currently, I am based in Oxford UK, but I am more than happy to relocate to the States because my fiancé is also moving to Massachusetts for a new job starting in September 2022. Should there be any questions related to my CV, previous experience, or skill sets, please feel free to reach out to me. I sincerely appreciate you take time to consider my application. Lastly, my favorite scientist is Marie Curie, who despite being a woman in a male dominated scientific fields, not only contributed hugely to the discovery of radiation but also tirelessly support X-ray radiograph in war zone during an intense period of human history. There is nothing sexier than what she had done as a scientist role model! -->

<Paligo Solution Engineer>
<!-- Dear Paligo Talent Acquisition team,
My name is Yi-Chun Wang and currently I work as an Imaging Solutions Scientist based in an Oxford biomedical technology company, Perspectum. I am writing to you to express my interest of joining Paligo as the Solutions Engineer (at USA and/or Solna). This role comes to my notice because I am an inspired user of Paligo and a huge supporter of the structure-based authoring and single-source publishing concepts. To give a few examples, I completed all Paligo’s webinars on Youtube and left the comments with the time stamps of important sections. These time stamps had also benefitted other Paligo user with their technical documentation journey (see Figure.1 below). In my personal blog, I wrote a Technical Writing Tips and Tricks with Paligo (see reference below). In Paligo’s community support forum, I am also an active member who contributed comments and new posts for feature suggestions (see Figure.2 below).
For the role as a Solutions Engineer, one major feature I would like to support development is to expand Paligo’s offering of single-source-publishing in graphic design. From previous communication with the support engineer Irfan in Paligo, I understood that currently, there isn’t existing solution, I therefore used systems such as Figma to batch exporting customized contents (see Figure.3 below); and use PowerPoint’s profiling option to present communications to difference target audience.
My experience of demonstrating the image acquisition support process is a good example of how I was able to use the tools Paligo, Figma and PowerPoint to troubleshoot and collaborate with other teams and customers. The goal of creating acquisition help center is to streamline the image acquisition support process by bringing the image acquisition manuals to a web-based format by publishing in HTML through Paligo. This way, if any support needed, the radiographers (in this case customer) can directly request support from the system. On another hand, once image acquisition is completed, the radiographers can immediately proceed with data upload, in turn achieve a true SaaS cycle. This help center-based process made management team aware that there is a large portion of the communications can be lost with the original support process; specifically, when the radiographers switch between the image acquisition workstation and PDF-based manuals and during the handling of data upload. Often, one support case can be resolved on the spot if the radiographer can quickly navigate to the correct instruction page on the acquisition help center. The lack of such possibility can cause the entire image acquisition cycle to re-start again, which is very costly. To demonstrate these complex back-and-forth interactions, I use PowerPoint’s profiling function to show relevant actions needed from customer operations, software, and marketing team (see reference below).
With my previous experience of Paligo, relevant skillsets stated in my CV and evidence of my active participation in Technical Writing community, I hope you understand this Solution Engineer role in your organization is very special and well-aligned with me. I have the confidence to excel in this role and would sincerely be grateful if you can give a consideration to my application. Thank you very much. -->
